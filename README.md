## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Sean. <br>
I am thankfully employed at NASA JSC as a GNC Engineer working on some of the coolest projects around.
## Professional Interests ðŸ¤“ðŸŒŒ
There is a lot but I think these are the main three.
* Anything GNC related, that blend of physics and algorithm is heavenly.
* Robotics, especially space applications and On-orbit servicing
* Simulation and Embedded Systems

If I had to say what letters I best speciaize at according to my title.
It would have to be Controls, Guidance, and Navigation.
## What I have worked on ðŸ”Ž
Can't say most of it due to the nature of my industry.
* Control Algorithms
* Simulation software for Air and Space missions
* Flight Software and Flight Software Testing
* vidya game with friends

## Whats Next? ðŸ”œ
I don't know but you can
probably find me on linkedin
and [here](https://seankhom.github.io/). <br>
I will try to update my projects but dont count on it. <br>
Hit me up if you want to discuss anything cool.
